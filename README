# LIMPACAT

The **Liver Immune Prediction Attention Transformer (LIMPACAT)** is a deep learning model specifically designed to predict immune cell composition in liver cancer. By leveraging **multi-omics data** and **whole-slide imaging (WSI)**, LIMPACAT provides a GPU-accelerated solution that enhances precision in liver cancer treatment. The model uses advanced transformer-based attention mechanisms to analyze immune cell patterns, aiding personalized treatment strategies.

Deep learning applications require complex, multi-stage data processing pipelines, including WSI-based cell composition detection, gene expression analysis, and survival analysis. These tasks are usually handled on the CPU, which can become a bottleneck in processing. LIMPACAT addresses this issue by utilizing GPU acceleration and Docker, offering efficient training and inference workflows.

LIMPACAT allows for a configurable input structure, supporting various cell types, data specifications, and training parameters, making it suitable for a range of liver cancer studies.

## LIMPACAT in Action

```python
import os
from limpacat.pipeline import initialize_pipeline, analyze_immune_cells, survival_analysis, train_model

data_root_dir = os.environ['LIMPACAT_DATA_PATH']
images_dir = os.path.join(data_root_dir, 'images')

# Load and initialize pipeline
pipeline = initialize_pipeline(images_dir, model_config='config.yaml')

# Analyze immune cell composition
immune_data = analyze_immune_cells(pipeline)

# Perform survival analysis
survival_data = survival_analysis(immune_data)

# Train model on WSI images
train_results = train_model(pipeline, immune_data)
