LIMPACAT
========
.. overview-begin-marker-do-not-remove

The Liver Immune Prediction Attention Transformer (LIMPACAT) is a deep learning model
specifically developed to predict immune cell composition in liver cancer. By leveraging
multi-omics data and whole-slide imaging (WSI), LIMPACAT offers a GPU-accelerated solution
that allows researchers and clinicians to enhance precision in liver cancer treatment.
The model uses advanced transformer-based attention mechanisms to accurately analyze
immune cell patterns, providing a powerful tool for personalized treatment strategies.

LIMPACAT integrates complex data processing workflows, including WSI-based cell composition
detection, gene expression analysis, and survival analysis, into a single, streamlined model.
Using Docker and GPU capabilities, LIMPACAT handles multi-stage preprocessing on a single pipeline,
increasing training and inference scalability.

LIMPACAT allows for a configurable input structure, supporting varied cell types, data specifications,
and training parameters, making it suitable for a range of liver cancer studies.

LIMPACAT in action:

.. code-block:: python

  import os
  from limpacat.pipeline import initialize_pipeline, analyze_immune_cells, survival_analysis, train_model

  data_root_dir = os.environ['LIMPACAT_DATA_PATH']
  images_dir = os.path.join(data_root_dir, 'images')

  # Load and initialize pipeline
  pipeline = initialize_pipeline(images_dir, model_config='config.yaml')

  # Analyze immune cell composition
  immune_data = analyze_immune_cells(pipeline)

  # Perform survival analysis
  survival_data = survival_analysis(immune_data)

  # Train model on WSI images
  train_results = train_model(pipeline, immune_data)
